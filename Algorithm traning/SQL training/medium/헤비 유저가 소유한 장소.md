## EXISTS (best efficiency)
~~~sql
SELECT *
from PLACES as A
where exists(
    select HOST_ID from PLACES as B
    WHERE A.HOST_ID = B.HOST_ID
    group by HOST_ID
    having count(*)>=2)
order by ID
~~~

## Subquery + where
~~~sql
SELECT A.ID, A.NAME, A.HOST_ID
from PLACES as A,
    (select HOST_ID from PLACES
    group by HOST_ID
    having count(*)>=2) as B
where A.HOST_ID=B.HOST_ID
order by ID
~~~

## Using IN (IN is slower than EXISTS because of full search)
~~~sql
SELECT *
from PLACES
where HOST_ID in(
    select HOST_ID from PLACES
    group by HOST_ID
    having count(*)>=2)
order by ID
~~~
