## GROUP BY + IN
~~~sql
select FOOD_TYPE, REST_ID, REST_NAME, FAVORITES
from REST_INFO
where (FOOD_TYPE, FAVORITES) in (
    SELECT FOOD_TYPE, max(FAVORITES)
    from REST_INFO
    group by FOOD_TYPE)
order by FOOD_TYPE desc
~~~

## Wrong SQL because max(FAVORITES) is printed regardless of the restaurant
~~~sql
SELECT FOOD_TYPE, REST_ID, REST_NAME, max(FAVORITES)
from REST_INFO
group by FOOD_TYPE
order by FOOD_TYPE desc
~~~
