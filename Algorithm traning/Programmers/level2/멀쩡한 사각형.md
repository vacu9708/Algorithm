## Euclidean Great Common Divisor algorithm
Fill 30 with 8(red), then the remainder is 6(blue). {a: 30, b: 8, new a: 8, new b: 6)

Filling 6 with 2 leaves no remainder, which means 2 is the GCD because 2 can fill both 8 and 30.

~~~python
def gcd(a,b):
    while b!=0:
        a,b=b,a%b
    return a
        
def solution(w,h):
    return w * h - (w/gcd(w, h) + h/gcd(w, h) - 1) * gcd(w, h)
